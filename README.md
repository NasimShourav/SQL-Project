# Nasim Al Goni's SQL Portfolio


Hello, and thank you for visiting! Within this repository, you'll find SQL examples I've created for personal projects and during my journey through various data analytics and machine learning courses. I've highlighted a few projects and also included data visualizations I've made using Tableau. Please explore the content, and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nasim-a-goni/) if you have any comments or inquiries.

## Highlighted Projects
* **Data Analysis for a newly opened Pizzashop** - [SQL](https://github.com/amymartika/SQL/blob/main/Spotify%20Top%20Songs%202021%20Data%20Analysis): This project considered the hypothetical scenario: The client, Alex, opened a new pizza shop and wants us to design a database model for him so that he can maintain the orders, staff, business shifts, and items. He provided us with some basic information (a brochure, to be specific) where we can only get the idea of the items he will sell along with a handwritten chart of all his staff and their role.
  In this project, I designed the backend of a database, normalized the tables, and drew their relations as per the business requirements, which will allow Alex not only to monitor the orders and sales but also to sort out the labor cost and top-selling items. I have bought the dataset from [learnbi](https://learnbi.online/).  
* **Analysis of worldwide covid vaccination and death rates** - [SQL](https://github.com/NasimShourav/SQL-Project/blob/main/Covid-death-and-Vac-Analysis.sql): The goal of this project is to analyze the covid death and vaccination data across the world. Key findings are the percentage of deaths, country-wise highest infection rate, country-wise and day-wise death percentage, the earliest date of vaccination in each country, new vaccinations per day, in every country across the world, etc. I have used the open dataset from [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects).
